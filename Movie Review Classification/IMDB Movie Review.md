# IMDB Movie Review

## Objective
Movie reviews are extremely important because of their significant effect on the consumer thought processes, they are not only used as a marketing tool, but also as a predictor as to how a film will perform financially. Review classification is responsible for grouping the reviews into one of the two categories;  positive and negative. This is a binary classification problem.

## Model
First off, I used an embedding layer with the GloVe file glove.6B.100d.txt, which is a sentence-transformers model, that maps sentences & paragraphs to a 300 dimensional dense vector space to be used for clustering or semantic search.
