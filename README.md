# Sentiment Analysis

## What it is
Sentiment analysis is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. The digital text is analyzed to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis tools can automatically determine the authorâ€™s attitude towards a topic by scanning this text.
